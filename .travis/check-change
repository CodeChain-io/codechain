# HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT IN .travis.yml
#   > SKIP=`.travis/check-change` && if [[ "$SKIP" = skip ]]; then exit 0; fi
# There are three possible output categories, and desired effects in this script
#  1. exit 0; stdout "skip"   -> Stop the process with a "Success" status.
#  2. exit 0; stdout "noskip" -> Do not skip the build process.
#  3. exit !0; stdout *;      -> Stop the process with a "Fail" status.
# For categories 1 and 2, the usage will be evaluated as follows:
#   > SKIP="skip" && if [[ "$SKIP" = skip ]]; then exit 0; fi
# `exit 0` is called, then stop the process with "Success" status.
#   > SKIP="noskip" && ...
# If the statement returns 0, it will continue the process.
# For 3., the usage will be evaluated like this, and bash operator `&&` will
# short-circuit the logic and propagate exit code.
#   > false && ...
# Statement that returned non-zero code will stop the process with a "Fail" status.
# FAILED ONE-LINER ATTEMPTS:
#   > if [[ `.travis/check` = skip ]] ...
# `If` consumes exit code of subshell. It will not be propagated.
#   > [[ `.travis/check` = skip ]] && exit 0
# It'll return non-zero code and the build will fail when the script prints "noskip".
#   > [[ `.travis/check` = skip ]] && exit 0 || echo "failed"
# It'll silently continue the process even if the script had exited with non-zero code.

# Everything that is normally printed to `stdout` in the script will be redirected to `stderr`
