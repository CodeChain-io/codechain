Although the node discovery is an indispensable part of a p2p network, the node discovery protocol is not a part of the CodeChain base protocol. Instead of defining it as a base protocol, CodeChain defines it as an extension to make it easily replaceable. This kind of extension is called **discovery protocol**.

It is also possible to run without node discovery protocol. In this case, the server only tries to connect to fixed servers.

# Kademlia-discovery

Kademlia-discovery is one of the discovery protocols that CodeChain provides. This is a subset of kademlia DHT protocol.

## Node Identification

Kademlia-discovery protocol uses 256-bits to distinguish node. This 256-bits identification is called `NodeId`. CodeChain uses the BLAKE2b hash of IP address to make them uniformly distributed and prevent [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack).

## Xor Distance

Kademlia-discovery protocol uses xor distance. Xor distance is symmetric. In other words, the distance from node A to node B is the same with the distance from node B to node A. This property is important because when node A is one of the closest nodes of node B, node B is also probably one of the closest nodes of node A. It reduces the load for managing networks.

## Message

Because CodeChain doesnâ€™t need features related to distributed storage, kademlia-discovery does not have `STORAGE` and `FIND_VALUE` messages. In addition, there is no need to check heartbeat since CodeChain uses TCP. Thus, CodeChain has only `FIND_NODE` and `NODE` message.

Every request has a message id. The corresponding response must epoch this id. The message id should not be reused until the response is received or the session is closed.
