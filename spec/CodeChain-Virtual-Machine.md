CodeChain Virtual Machine (CCVM) is a stack machine with limited memory size, and can save an arbitrary length byte array as an item.

# Machine specification
* All stack items are byte arrays of arbitrary length
* Maximum stack depth is 1024
* Maximum memory occupation of stack is 1KB
* If memory grows to be larger than 1KB, the machine must fail immediately
* If script tries to push when stack has 1024 items, the machine must fail immediately
* If script tries to pop when stack is empty, the machine must fail immediately

# Type Conversion
Although CCVM itself doesnâ€™t have any type notations, some instructions treat stack items as specific type (e.g. Integer, boolean). Following rules are applied when instruction tries to convert byte array to desired types.

## Integer

### Byte array -> Integer:

* Byte array MUST fit in 8 bytes.
* Byte array is decoded with little-endian byte ordering.
* All items are decoded as unsigned integer.
* Empty array is decoded as 0 in integer.

### Integer -> Byte array:

Leading zeros must be truncated. Note that it is allowed to decode value with leading zeros as integer.

## Boolean

### Byte array -> Boolean:
* false if byte array is empty, or all elements of array is zero
* true otherwise

### Boolean -> Byte array:
* true is encoded as [0x01]
* false is encoded as []

# Instructions

## Special instructions
* NOP(0x00): Do nothing
* BURN(0x01): Stop script execution, and return `BURN` as result.
* SUCCESS(0x02): Stop script execution, and return `SUCCESS` as result.
* FAIL(0x03): Stop script execution, and return `FAIL` as result.

## Boolean computation
* NOT(0x10): Pop one value from stack as boolean, and push negated value.
* EQ(0x11): Pop two values from stack. Push true if two blobs were exactly equal. Push false otherwise.

## Flow Control
* JMP(0x20)
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Skip n - 1 instructions
* JNZ(0x21)
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Pop one value from stack as boolean.
 1. If popped value is true, skip n instructions. If value was false, go to next instruction.
* JZ(0x22)
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Pop one value from stack as boolean.
 1. If popped value is false, skip n instructions. If value was true, go to next instruction.

## Stack manipulation
* PUSH(0x30): Read next script byte, and push single element array containing that value to stack.
* POP(0x31): Pop one item from stack.
* PUSHB(0x32)
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Read next n script bytes from script
 1. Push values from 2. as array to stack
* DUP(0x33): Push copy of topmost value in stack.
* SWAP(0x34): Swap topmost two values in stack.
* COPY(0x35):
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Duplicate nth stack item (stack top is 0th value) to stack top.
* DROP(0x36):
 1. Read next script byte(refer this value as n)
 1. Remove nth stack item (stack top is 0th value).

## Cryptography
* CHKSIG(0x80)
 1. Pop two values, first one as signature, second one as public key
 1. Verify signature via full transaction message, excluding script parameter
 1. Push true on success, false otherwise.
* BLAKE256(0x90): Pop one value from stack, and push blake-256 hash of it. Blake-256 here refers to blake2b with 32 byte output.
* SHA256(0x91): Pop one value from stack, and push sha-256 hash of it.
* RIPEMD160(0x92): Pop one value from stack, and push ripemd160 hash of it.
* KECCAK256(0x93): Pop one value from stack, and push keccak-256 hash of it.
* BLAKE160(0x94): Pop one value from stack, and push blake-160 hash of it. Blake-160 here refers to blake2b with 20 byte output.

## Environment
* BLKNUM(0xa0): Push block number specified in parcel to stack as integer. If there's no specified block number, machine must fail immediately.
