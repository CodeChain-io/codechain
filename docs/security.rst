Different from common bugs, security issues that are an immediate threat to CodeChain's well-being
should be reported directly to us at codechain@kodebox.io. When reporting such security issues,
it would be of great help if you refer to the following guidelines:

Security issues fall into one of three categories. These three categories are classified as 3 levels:
**P1(high)**, **P2(medium)**, and **P3(low)**.

* **P1(high)**: a security vulnerability that will result in loss of value.

    e.g. Steal tokens from someone, mint tokens at your discretion

* **P2(medium)**: a security vulnerability that will not result in loss of value but can result in a loss of function of the CodeChain engine.

    e.g. Block actions for all users

* **P3(low)**: a security vulnerability that will not result in loss of value or function but can cause great inconvenience for some fraction of users.

    e.g. Block a user from transferring tokens

When reporting security issues, please mention the security issue's category in the email's subject/title.
