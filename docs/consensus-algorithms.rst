Consensus Algorithms
#########################

CodeChain offers a pluggable consensus model, which provides flexibility. You can choose the consensus model that best suits your needs. If the existing consensus models do not meet your business requirements, you can easily create your own consensus model.

Currently, CodeChain supports four consensus algorithms. Each consensus algorithm has its own strengths,
which is why a variety is being offered.
