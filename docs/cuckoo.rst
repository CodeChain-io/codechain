Cuckoo

Cuckoo aims to be resistant to Bitcoin style hardware arms-races by making its algorithm memory bound. Thus, solution times should be bound to
memory bandwidth instead of other forms of raw processing power. As a result, Cuckoo should be a viable solution for running on most commodity
hardware, and require far less energy than other forms of PoW algorithms that are bound to GPU, CPU or ASIC.
