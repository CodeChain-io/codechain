Gitter Rooms
======================
Gitter serves as the coworking space where devs share feedback, ask questions, or just hang out. Devs are usually online, so Gitter is probably the best
place to get a quick hold of someone with something important.

To go directly to CodeChain's Gitter rooms, click `here <https://gitter.im/CodeChain-io>`_. We currently have a room for each of the ongoing projects:

* `codechain`_: CodeChain engine related
* `codechain-explorer`_: for looking up information, such as accounts or assets that belong in CodeChain.
* `codechain-gateway`_: used for linking a certain service/server with CodeChain.
* `codechain-sdk-js`_: JavaScript SDK for CodeChain

If you are not sure of which room is suitable for your topic, go to `codechain`_ and make your inquiries there.

Stack Exchange
=====================
The `CodeChain Stack Exchange <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/119664/codechain>`_ is where you can ask your questions. This is the best place
to ask technical questions. The questions here are preserved for future references.
