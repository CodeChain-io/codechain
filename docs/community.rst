Gitter Rooms
======================
Gitter serves as the coworking space where devs share feedback, ask questions, or just hang out. Devs are usually online, so Gitter is probably the best
place to get a quick hold of someone with something important.

To go directly to CodeChain's Gitter rooms, click `here <https://gitter.im/CodeChain-io>`_. We currently have a room for each of the ongoing projects:

* `codechain`_: CodeChain engine related.
* `codechain-explorer`_: for looking up information, such as accounts or assets that belong in CodeChain.
* `codechain-sdk-js`_: JavaScript SDK for CodeChain.
* `codechain-agent-hub`_: responsible for retrieving information from the agent, such as information of CodeChain's current status, or other hardware information, such as CPU and memory usage.
* `codechain-wallet`_: the wallet that CodeChain provides for the user.
* `codechain-gateway`_: the component that can pay the transaction fees in place of another user. The gateway also verifies whether transactions are following specific rules.
* `codechain-exchange`_: the exchange where various trades of assets can be made.
* `codechain-helicopter`_: tool created for providing random airdrops of CCC or assets.
