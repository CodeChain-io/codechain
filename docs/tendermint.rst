`Tendermint <https://tendermint.com/>`_ is a Proof-of-Stake algorithm which is designed to tolerate machines that fail in arbitrary ways,
which is also known as Byzantine fault tolerance(BFT). Tendermint claims that even if 1/3 of the machines fail, it will still operate properly,
offering a secure and consistent system.
