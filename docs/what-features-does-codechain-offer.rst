What features does CodeChain offer?
====================================
Key features include a built-in multi-asset management solution, which enable users to issue, transfer and manage currencies,
tokens and/or digital items on a blockchain network, all without the need of smart contracts.

CodeChain also offers programmability. More specifically, transactions are programmable. Things such as random item generation, asset evolution,
fusion, etc, which are features difficult to implement with existing blockchain technologies, can now be done more efficiently
and effortlessly.

Finally, CodeChain offers higher transaction speeds with its scalability feature, made available via sharding. Horizontal scaling has potential
to bring faster transactions than ever before on a blockchain.
