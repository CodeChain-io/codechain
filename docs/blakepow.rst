BlakePoW follows the Proof-of-Work model of Bitcoin, where a hash is calculated by adding the nonce and the block hash. It is then checked whether
this added value is less than or equal to the target value over and over again. If you want an algorithm not bound to forms of processing power,
please use Cuckoo.
